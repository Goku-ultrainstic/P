        <p>Billie Eilish (born December 18, 2001, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) first gained recognition in 2015 for the song <b><i>"Ocean Eyes"</i></b>and became, in 2020, the youngest person ever to win a Grammy for the album of the year, for <b>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</b>Her other works include Happier Than Ever (2021) and the award-winning song <b>"What Was I Made For?</b>which was recorded for the Barbie (2023) soundtrack.
        Eilish's parents were inspired by Hanson, a 90's pop band by a group of homeschooled brothers from Tusla, Oklahoma, to teach their children at home and encourage them to expoore outside of the traditional education system. As a child, Eilish experimented with horseback riding, dance and singing as a member of the Los Angeles Children's Chorus. In 2015 Eilish's elder brother, Finneas Baird O'connell, who performs underthe moniker <b><i>Finneas</i></b>, enlistened her to sing <i>Ocean Eyes</i>a song he had written and produced for his band at the time and later put online. The song quickly gained success, and -eilis signed with the boutique label Darkroom in the summer of 2016.
       <b><i>Darkroom released Eilish's Don't Smile At Me in August 2017</i></b>, an eigth-song EP <i>written by Billie Eilish and Finneas.</i>The EP was reissued with a bonus track in December 2017; two more bonus tracks were added in later reissues. Following its release, Donâ€™t Smile at Me peaked at 14 on the Billboard 200 chart.</p>
